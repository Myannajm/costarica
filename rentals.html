  <h1>Housing Rentals in Costa Rica</h1>
<div class="container">
  <p>Costa Rica is a very popular place for many expats, due to the lower cost of living, rich cultural experience, and the relative safety and ease that comes with moving here. You can find a wide variety of inexpensive housing in Costa Rica, whether you rent or buy, and a wealth of every imaginable activity to keep you busy and happy.  If you move to Costa Rica, you can live comfortably on $2,500 to $3,000 per month, depending on your lifestyle. Personally, as I was only living here for a year I rented out an AirBnB on a monthly basis, which is a popular option for certain lengths of extended stays. Below are three properties I would suggest looking into as a start to your house hunting. Check out the links below for more rental information!</p>
